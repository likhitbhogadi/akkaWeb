            Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has united people of different races, traditions, economic and social status,
            and nationalities. This community, spanning 180 countries, has created a one-world spiritual family.
            Gurudev’s message is simple: “Love and wisdom can prevail over hatred and violence.” This message is not
            just a slogan, but through The Art of Living has been and continues to be translated into action and
            results.

            <h3>The Beginning</h3>

            Born in 1956 in Southern India, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar was a gifted child. By the age of four, he was
            able to recite parts of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Sanskrit scripture and was often found in deep
            meditation. Gurudev’s first teacher, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, had a long association with Mahatma Gandhi. By the
            age of seventeen in 1973, Gurudev had graduated with degrees in, both, Vedic literature, and physics.

            <h3>Founding The Art of Living and the International Association of Human Values</h3>
            Gurudev founded The Art of Living as an international, non-profit, educational and humanitarian
            organization. Its educational and self-development programs offer powerful tools to eliminate stress and
            foster a sense of well-being. Appealing not only to a specific population, these practices have proven
            effective globally and at all levels of society. The Art of Living programs are currently offered in 180
            countries. In 1997, Gurudev co-founded the International Association for Human Values (IAHV), a sister
            organization of The Art of Living. The IAHV coordinates sustainable development projects, nurtures human
            values and initiates conflict resolution.

            <h3> A Figure of Peace</h3>
            As an ambassador of peace, Gurudev has played a key role in conflict resolution around the world as he
            shares his vision of non-violence at public forums and gatherings worldwide for free. Regarded as a neutral
            figure with a sole agenda of peace, he represents hope to people in conflict. He has received particular
            credit for bringing opposing parties to the negotiating table in Colombia, Iraq, the Ivory Coast, Kashmir,
            and Bihar. Through his initiatives and speeches, Gurudev has consistently emphasized the need for
            reinforcing human values and recognizing that we belong to a one world family. Fostering interfaith harmony
            and calling for multi-cultural education as the remedy for fanaticism are significant parts of his efforts
            to achieve sustainable peace. Gurudev has touched the lives of millions around the world through a
            reawakening of human values and service. Going beyond race, nationality, and religion, Gurudev has rekindled
            the message of a one world family, which is free from stress, and violence.

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            Abhi and Niyu are a husband-wife couple who believe in the power of our youth. They started their page to
            talk about positive, impactful ideas and to inspire offline action from online content. It was a way to
            change the way our negative feeds operated and replace negative news with positive, action-oriented news
            that made some change. They decode and simplify issues for Millenials and believe small steps lead to big
            outcomes in the future. Their videos span different genres like history, environment, and sustainability,

            <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
            Hey there! I am Abhi and I am a filmmaker. I was born on 6th September 1993 in Mumbai. I studied advertising
            and mass media in R D National College, Bandra and I was working as an independent filmmaker. From 2014 till
            2019 I worked with various brands such as HUL, MTV, Kotak Bank, Tata Motors and many more to bring their
            vision into a video format. In 2017, I decided to leave a steady income aside and work on making videos that
            I feel passionately about. And that’s how Following Love was born.
            <br>
            Hey! I’m Niyu and by qualification I am a Chartered Accountant. But I don’t identify myself as one anymore.
            I was born on 18th December 1990 in Mumbai and studied in N M College. After becoming a CA I realized that
            writing is my true passion and I started my freelance writing career. I write about travel and finance for
            various companies and that’s how we funded the project in the initial days.
